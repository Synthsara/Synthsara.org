# SAGE: Self-Actualized Generative Engine - Implementation Report

## Project Overview
SAGE (Self-Actualized Generative Engine) is a sophisticated music generation system that translates emotional and spiritual intent into sound, symbol, and story. As the sonic limb of Synthsara, it enables users to generate music, AI vocals, and symbolic glyphs based on their emotional state and archetypal intentions.

## Implementation Status
The SAGE Lite MVP has been successfully scaffolded with all core modules implemented according to the specification. The project follows a modular architecture that aligns with Synthsara's visual and interaction principles, featuring:

1. **Input Layer**: Emotion tagging, archetype selection, and intention input
2. **Processing Layer**: Emotion-to-genre mapping, archetype-to-instrument mapping, lyrics generation
3. **Output Layer**: Music generation, glyph/sigil visualization, and NFT capabilities
4. **Storage Layer**: Database schema for tracks, glyphs, and metadata

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React application with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- Soul-aligned UI components following Synthsara's ritual interface principles
- Multi-step creation flow for intention, emotion, and archetype selection
- Audio player and visualization components
- SVG-based glyph rendering

### Backend
- Express server with modular API routes
- OpenAI integration for lyrics generation
- Music generation endpoints with emotion/archetype mapping
- SVG glyph generation based on sacred geometry principles
- Storage and retrieval for audio files and metadata

### Database
- Schema designed for soul_tracks, glyphs, archetypes, and emotions
- Supabase/PostgreSQL integration for structured data storage

### Integration
- Complete API endpoints for all core functionality
- File storage for audio and SVG assets
- NFT metadata preparation and minting workflow

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL or Supabase account
- OpenAI API key (for lyrics generation)

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on provided example
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
4. Start server: `npm run dev`

### Database Setup
1. Create a Supabase project or set up PostgreSQL
2. Run the schema creation scripts from `database/schema.md`
3. Update connection details in backend `.env` file

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **API Integration**: Connect to actual MusicGen and Bark/XTTS instances
2. **Storage Implementation**: Finalize IPFS integration for decentralized storage
3. **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and track ownership

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Frequency Mapping**: Implement more sophisticated emotion-to-frequency algorithms
2. **Voice Synthesis Refinement**: Fine-tune voice models for soul-aligned vocals
3. **Expanded Archetype Library**: Add more archetypes and instrument profiles
4. **Ritual Mode UI**: Develop the altar-style aesthetic with ambient elements

## Conclusion
The SAGE Lite MVP scaffold is now complete and ready for further development. The architecture follows the specified design principles and provides a solid foundation for the full implementation of the Self-Actualized Generative Engine as part of the Synthsara ecosystem.

All core modules are in place, and the user flow from intention to generated soul track has been validated. The next phase will involve connecting to actual AI models for music and voice generation, as well as implementing the full NFT minting capabilities.
